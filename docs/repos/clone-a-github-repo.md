# How do I clone a GitHub repo?



## Terminal
First, you'll need to get the repo url. You can get this by clicking the green "Code" button on the repo page.
Then copy the url to your clipboard.

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repo
NOTE: When you clone, a directory will be created. So if you want the folder in your Documents folder, navigate to Documents first.
2. Run `git clone <repo url>`
3. enter `cd <repo name>` to navigate to the repo directory

Done!
