# How do I make a new GitHub repo?

## VS Code
1. Click "Source Control" in the left sidebar
2. Click "initialize repository"
3. Click "Publish to GitHub"

You may be asked to login to GitHub if you haven't already.

That's it! 

You can also make a repo from GitHub first and then clone it to your local machine.
But do it this way, it's easier.
