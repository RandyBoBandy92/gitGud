# Where are all the git commands in VS Code?

So the source control area in VS Code is pretty minimalistic. It only shows you changed files, and that's about it.

So, say if I wanted to merge a branch, or switch branches, or do anything else, where would I go?

Well, you can go to the command palette, and type in `git`, and you'll see a bunch of commands.
