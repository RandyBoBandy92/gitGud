# What is git status?

`git status` is a command that shows you the current state of your git repo. It will tell you what branch you are on, if you have any uncommitted changes, and if you have any unpushed commits.

it will look like this:

```bash
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   ../docs/general/what-is-git-stash.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        ../docs/general/what-is-git-status.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
